Alchex ⚛⚗😎
==========
_(Alk-Ex)_

Alchex uses GROMACS to robustly exchange one molecule for another using a method based on [Exchange Lipids](#exchange-lipids) and removes clashes using the [Alchembed method](#alchembed). Documentation is coming soon, but in the meantime, [try it out for yourself](#get-started).

Get started
-----------

### 1. Install Alchex

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tomnewport/alchex.git
```

### 2. Test installation

```python
import alchex
```
