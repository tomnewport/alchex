### **Phosphatidylcholine** (PC) biosynthesis

- Historical Background
    - **PC** first described by Gobley in 1847
        - Named lecithin (egg yolk)
    - Diakonow and Strecker
        - two fatty acids linked by glycerol
        - choline attatched to third hydroxyl by phosphodiester
    - Charles Best
        - Animals require choline
    - **CDP-choline pathway** for **PC** biosynthesis
        - Eugene Kennedy et al
        - CTP not ATP is activating nucleotide for PC biosynthesis
        - CTP required for PC biosynthesis
            - Required for denovo synthesis of all phospholipids except PA
    - Alternative pathway
        - In liver
        - PE to PC via PE [15N]choline
        - Transfer of methyl groups from S-adenosylmethionine
- **Choline transport and oxidation**
    - Choline not made de novo in animals except:
        - by methylation of PE to PC
        - Then hydrolysis of choline moiety from PC
    - Imported from extracellular sources
    - Cells require for growth and division
    - Two entry mechanisms
        - High affinity
            - NA dependent transporter
        - Low afffinity
            - NA independent transporter
    - Once in cell, rapidly phosphorylated by **choline kinase**
    - In neurons converted to **acetylcholine** neurotransmitter.
    - In liver and mitochondria oxidised to betaine
- **Choline Kinase**
    - **Choline** to **Choline-P**
    - Three isoforms
        - &alpha;1
            - Most abundant in testes
        - &alpha;2
            - Splice varient of &alpha;1
        - &alpha;3
- **CTP:Phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase** (CT)
    - Homodimer
    - Active when membrane associated
    - Two genes (Pcyt1a, Pcyt1b) - encode two isoforms
        - CT&alpha; 
        - CT&beta;

    - also nuclear matrix, associated with nuclear membrane
    - temperature sensitive mutant
        - CT abolished, cells die via apoptosis
    - has nuclear localisation signal (res 8-28)
    - possible CT migrates to cytoplasm during G1 phase of mitosis
    - *TN: obvs this will cure cancer*
    - Lipid binding domain of CT&alpha; regulates binding to membranes and activation of CT
        - Phosphorylation segment is after r314
        - Cts truncated at r236 lack phosphorylation and lipid binding domains
        - Binding of lipids decreases Km
- **CDP-choline: 1,2-diacylglycerol cholinephosphotransferase** (cholinephosphotransferase)
    - Located on ER
        - also golgi, MAM, nuclear
    - Never been purified
    - Branchpint in metabolism of DG
        - Conversion to PE, TG and PA
    - Excess of activity, not limiting
    - Regulated by substrate supply (upstream CT)
    - DG supply regulated by upstream fatty acids
    - Excess DG stored in liver as TG
- **Phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase** (PEMT)
    - All nucleated cells contain PC and use CDP-choline pathway
    - but PE Methylation is alternative pathway
    - Liver specific (50x other tissues)
    - Produces 1x PC and 3x S-ademosylhomocysteine
        - S-ademosylhomocysteine catabolysed to homocysteine

        - Suckling mothers
    - PC has three methyl groups
        - PC analogue phosphatidyldimethylethanolamine has two and is not suitable replacement
    - PC is cylindrical, PE is conical - replacement of PC by PE comprimises cell membrane
    - Yeast uses PEMT and CDP Choline
    - Bacteria generally not PC
        - Some bacteria convert PE to PC 
            - Enzyme has little homology with PEMT
### Regulation of phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis
- Rate-Limiting Reaction
    - CT reaction usually limits rate of PC biosynthesis
- Translocation Hypothesis
    - CT both in cytosol and microsomal membranes
    - Correlation between CT activity on membranes and PC synthesis
    - CT translocated from cytosol to membrane
        - Electrostatic absorbtion
        - Hydrophobic interactions
            - Intercalation of protein to non-polar core
    - Viscous gel-phase lipids
    - Binds electrostatically but not activated
    - Properties promote insertion
        - Interfacial packing defects - small headgroups in membrane
        - Low lateral surface area (loose packing - highly curved membranes)
        - Acyl chain disorder caused by oxidation of fatty acid chains
        - Curvature strain caused by PE and DG
        - PC synthesis reverses properties
        - *TN: nice regulatory mechanism*
- Regulation of phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis by lipids
    - DG alters rate of PC synthesis by modulating CT binding
    - Increase in DG content of membranes enhances CT binding in vitro
    - Sec14p transfers PI or PC between membranes
        - Preference for PI
    - PC-bound Sec14p inhibits CDP-choline pathway via CT
    - PI-bound Sec14p has minimal inhibition
    - Feedback inhibition
    - CTP may also regulate
- Phosphorylation of cytidylyltransferase
    - CT&alpha; is phosphorylated - phosphorylation affects CT activity.
    - CT bound to membranes is less phosphorylated
    - CT binds when phosphorylated, dephosphorylated subsequently
    - Lipid composition change mediates initial CT binding
    - Deletion of phosphorylation domain does not impair survival
- Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of CT&alpha;
    - Most studies do not indicate expression regulation
    - Translocation is usual regulator
    - Some possible regulatory elements

    - PG and friends
        - PG-phosphate made from G3P and CDP-DAG
            - catalysed by PG-P synthase

### Mechanisms Proposed for Inter-Organelle Phospholipid Transport

- General mechanistic considerations
    - Final step mostly on ER membranes
    - Transport must exist
    - SM enriched in plasma membrane
        - synthesised on golgi
    - CL biosynthesis in mitochondria, restricted to mitochondria
        - Precursor made in both ER and mitochondria
    - more PG made in mitochondria than ER
    - phospholipids do not freely equilibrate
    - most phospholipids poorly soluable in water
    - some hydrophilic PS species more readily transported to mitochondria
    - spontaneous diffusion cannot be excluded
    - 1.5 hour half-time for PC transfer between plasma lipoproteins
    - mechanisms
        - soluable transport proteins
        - vesicles
        - close contact between membranes
- Inter-organelle phospholipid transport via cytosolic lipid transfer proteins
    - Intuitively shuttle process
        - Protein extracts PC monomer from ER, transports to target organelle
        - Specificity of lipid and target
        - experiments show 5 mins to get from ER to plasma membrane and mitochondria
            - PE 2 hours
            - Phospholipid transport proteins from cytosol
    - Several proteins characterised
        - accelerate PC exchange
        - START motif implicated in lipid metabolism
        - PC transfer protein proposed to mediate PC transport from ER to other organelles
        - High concentration in liver and lung 
            - mediates PC transport for bile secretion in liver
            - surfactant in lungs
            - not compromised in knockout
        - function unknown - not major role
    - non-specific lipid transfer protein (sterol carrier protein-2)
        - cytosol and peroxysomes
        - major role for import of fatty acids to peroxisome
        - elimination did not alter lipid composition
    - PI Transfer protein PITP
        - soluable cytosolic proteins
        - bind and transger PI and PC
        - similar to yeast Sec14
        - Associates with golgi membranes
        - may transfer PI from Er to plasma membrane
        - KO is lethal
- Via vesicles
    - bud from ER and transport protein through golgi stacks
    - trans-golgi exports and fuses with plasma membrane
    - expected to deliver lipids
        - mammalian fibroblasts
            - pathways for transport of PC and cholesterol distinct from vesicle mediated pathway
            - disruption affects protein half-time, not lipids
    - different vesicles?
    - PE from ER to plasma membrane investigated
        - cytoskeleton disruption did not impede PE transport
    - not a single mechanism
- Via membrane contact sites
    - close juxtaposition of membranes
    - multiprotein tethering complexes
    - EM studies confirm existance
    - 20% of HeLA cell mitochondeia closely apposed to ER
    - 10-30nm separation - protein bridge?
    - PS from ER to mitochondria
        - MAM may mediate transfer of phospholipids
        - transfer appears rate-limiting for conversion of PS to PE
    - PE from ER to mitochondria
        - not established
