Vance - Phospholipid Biosynthesis in eukaryotes
-----------------------------------------------

### Summary
- Roles:
    - Components of cell membranes, barrier for entry
    - Second messengers
        - **Diacylglycerol**
        - **inositol-1,4,5-P3**
    - Storage of energy
        - Fatty acyl components
        - Extreme conditions e.g. starvation
- **Phosphatidic Acid** (PA)
    - Intermediate in branchpoint
    - PA biosynthesis
        - Activation of fatty acids by **acyl CoA synthetase**s
            - Yields **acyl CoA**
            - 5 forms of rat **acyl CoA synthetase** identified
            - Enzyme found in ER, mitochondria and mitochondria associated membranes
            - May provide distinct pools
    - Precursor of **phospholipid**s and **triacylglycerol**s
### 2 Phosphatidic acid biosynthesis and conversion to diacylglycerol
- *Phosphatidic acid** (PA)
    - Branchpoint in glycerolipid biosynthesis
    - **Kornberg and Pricer**
        - Fatty acids activated to Acyl CoA prior to reaction with **glycerol-3-P**
        - Glycerol-3-P is precursor of **Acyl CoA**
    - Fatty acids activated by **acyl CoA synthetase**s to form **acyl CoA**
    - May be distinct pools of **acyl CoA** for phospholipid synthesis or triacylglycerol synthesis.
- **Glycerol-3-P acyltransferase**
    - Catalyses first committed reaction in biosynthesis of PA.
        - Production of **lyso-PA**
    - Not clear what regulatory role is
    - Mammals - 2 **glycerol-3-P acyltransferase**s identified
        - **GPAT1** - mitochondrial
            - not inhibited by N-ethylmaleimide
            - Prefers **palmitoyl-CoA** as acyl donor over **olyl CoA**
        - **GPAT3** - ER
            - inhibited by **N-ethylmaleimide**
            - No preference for saturated vs. unsaturated fatty acids
