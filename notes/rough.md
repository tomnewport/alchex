### **Phosphatidylcholine** (PC) biosynthesis

- Historical Background
    - **PC** first described by Gobley in 1847
        - Named lecithin (egg yolk)
    - Diakonow and Strecker
        - two fatty acids linked by glycerol
        - choline attatched to third hydroxyl by phosphodiester
    - Charles Best
        - Animals require choline
    - **CDP-choline pathway** for **PC** biosynthesis
        - Eugene Kennedy et al
        - CTP not ATP is activating nucleotide for PC biosynthesis
        - CTP required for PC biosynthesis
            - Required for denovo synthesis of all phospholipids except PA
    - Alternative pathway
        - In liver
        - PE to PC via PE [15N]choline
        - Transfer of methyl groups from S-adenosylmethionine
- **Choline transport and oxidation**
    - Choline not made de novo in animals except:
        - by methylation of PE to PC
        - Then hydrolysis of choline moiety from PC
    - Imported from extracellular sources
    - Cells require for growth and division
    - Two entry mechanisms
        - High affinity
            - NA dependent transporter
        - Low afffinity
            - NA independent transporter
    - Once in cell, rapidly phosphorylated by **choline kinase**
    - In neurons converted to **acetylcholine** neurotransmitter.
    - In liver and mitochondria oxidised to betaine
- **Choline Kinase**
    - **Choline** to **Choline-P**
    - Three isoforms
        - &alpha;1
            - Most abundant in testes
        - &alpha;2
            - Splice varient of &alpha;1
        - &alpha;3
- **CTP:Phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase** (CT)
    - Homodimer
    - Active when membrane associated
    - Two genes (Pcyt1a, Pcyt1b) - encode two isoforms
        - CT&alpha; 
        - CT&beta;
    - Found in cytosol
    - also nuclear matrix, associated with nuclear membrane
    - temperature sensitive mutant
        - CT abolished, cells die via apoptosis
    - has nuclear localisation signal (res 8-28)
    - possible CT migrates to cytoplasm during G1 phase of mitosis
    - *TN: obvs this will cure cancer*
    - Lipid binding domain of CT&alpha; regulates binding to membranes and activation of CT
        - Phosphorylation segment is after r314
        - Cts truncated at r236 lack phosphorylation and lipid binding domains
        - Binding of lipids decreases Km
- **CDP-choline: 1,2-diacylglycerol cholinephosphotransferase** (cholinephosphotransferase)
    - Located on ER
        - also golgi, MAM, nuclear
    - Never been purified
    - Branchpint in metabolism of DG
        - Conversion to PE, TG and PA
    - Excess of activity, not limiting
    - Regulated by substrate supply (upstream CT)
    - DG supply regulated by upstream fatty acids
    - Excess DG stored in liver as TG
- **Phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase** (PEMT)
    - All nucleated cells contain PC and use CDP-choline pathway
    - but PE Methylation is alternative pathway
    - Liver specific (50x other tissues)
    - Produces 1x PC and 3x S-ademosylhomocysteine
        - S-ademosylhomocysteine catabolysed to homocysteine
        - homocysteine recycled to methyonine, cystathionine or secreted
    - PEMT accounts for half of plasma homocysteine - independent cardiovascular disease risk factor
    - Intrinsic membrane protein
    - Two types exist, only one in mice and humans
    - Backup PC supply when CDP-choline pathway less active
        - Starvation
        - Pregnancy
        - Suckling mothers
    - PC has three methyl groups
        - PC analogue phosphatidyldimethylethanolamine has two and is not suitable replacement
    - PC is cylindrical, PE is conical - replacement of PC by PE comprimises cell membrane
    - Yeast uses PEMT and CDP Choline
    - Bacteria generally not PC
        - Some bacteria convert PE to PC 
            - Enzyme has little homology with PEMT
### Regulation of phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis
- Rate-Limiting Reaction
    - CT reaction usually limits rate of PC biosynthesis
- Translocation Hypothesis
    - CT both in cytosol and microsomal membranes
    - Correlation between CT activity on membranes and PC synthesis
    - CT translocated from cytosol to membrane
        - Electrostatic absorbtion
        - Hydrophobic interactions
            - Intercalation of protein to non-polar core
    - Viscous gel-phase lipids
    - Binds electrostatically but not activated
    - Properties promote insertion
        - Interfacial packing defects - small headgroups in membrane
        - Low lateral surface area (loose packing - highly curved membranes)
        - Acyl chain disorder caused by oxidation of fatty acid chains
        - Curvature strain caused by PE and DG
        - PC synthesis reverses properties
        - *TN: nice regulatory mechanism*
- Regulation of phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis by lipids
    - DG alters rate of PC synthesis by modulating CT binding
    - Increase in DG content of membranes enhances CT binding in vitro
    - Sec14p transfers PI or PC between membranes
        - Preference for PI
    - PC-bound Sec14p inhibits CDP-choline pathway via CT
    - PI-bound Sec14p has minimal inhibition
    - Feedback inhibition
    - CTP may also regulate
- Phosphorylation of cytidylyltransferase
    - CT&alpha; is phosphorylated - phosphorylation affects CT activity.
    - CT bound to membranes is less phosphorylated
    - CT binds when phosphorylated, dephosphorylated subsequently
    - Lipid composition change mediates initial CT binding
    - Deletion of phosphorylation domain does not impair survival
- Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of CT&alpha;
    - Most studies do not indicate expression regulation
    - Translocation is usual regulator
    - Some possible regulatory elements
