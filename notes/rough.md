### 2 Phosphatidic acid biosynthesis and conversion to diacylglycerol

- **Phosphatidic acid** (PA)
    - Branchpoint in glycerolipid biosynthesis
    - **Kornberg and Pricer**
        - Fatty acids activated to Acyl CoA prior to reaction with **glycerol-3-P**
        - Glycerol-3-P is precursor of **Acyl CoA**
    - Fatty acids activated by **acyl CoA synthetase**s to form **acyl CoA**
    - May be distinct pools of **acyl CoA** for phospholipid synthesis or triacylglycerol synthesis.
- **Glycerol-3-P acyltransferase**
    - Catalyses first committed reaction in biosynthesis of PA.
        - Production of **lyso-PA**
    - Not clear what regulatory role is
    - Mammals - 2 **glycerol-3-P acyltransferase**s identified
        - **GPAT1** - mitochondrial
            - not inhibited by **N-ethylmaleimide**
            - Prefers **palmitoyl-CoA** as acyl donor over **olyl CoA**
                - Thought to be responsible for abubdance of saturated fatty acids in **sn-1 position** of **glycerophospholipids**
            - Localised in **mitochondrial outer membrane** with active site facing cytosol
            - Deletion results in decrease in **TG** and cholesterol content of liver
            - Transcriptional regulation
                - decreased by starvation and glucagon
                - increased by high-carbohydrate diet
                - Animals do not need to make **TG** or phospholipids if energy supply is limited.
            - Studied when linked to **luciferace reporter**
                - **Sterol response element-binding protein** (SREBP) and **NF-Y** transcription factors important in stimulating GPAT
                - **SREBP** is key regulator
                    - synthesis of cholesterol and fatty acids
                    - fatty acid desaturation
                    - Reasonable to assume **SREBP** enhances **glycerolipid** biosynthesus
                        - particularly **TG**
                        - by increasing expression of GPAT
        - **GPAT3** - ER
            - inhibited by **N-ethylmaleimide**
            - No preference for saturated vs. unsaturated fatty acids
            - Little transcriptional regulation
- **Acylglycerol-3-P acyltransferase**
    - Less known
    - Second step in **PA** biosynthetic pathway
    - Multiple encoding genes identified
    - Activity lower in mitochondria than in ER
    - Presumed much of **lyso-PA** formed in mitochondria transfered to ER for second **acylation** step
    - Carrier protein not required for transfer
    - Esterification at **sn-2** position uses mainly unsaturated fatty acids
    - Types of fatty **acyl-CoA**s available influence **acyl-CoA** species selected for transfer to **lyso-PA**
    - **Congenital generalised lysodystrophy**
        - Disease characterised by decreased adipose tissue

    - Some reports of other localisation - peroxisomal contamination
    - Important in lipid biosynthesis
    - **1-acyldihydroxyacetone-P** forms
        - Elsewhere used as substrate for **1-alkyldihydroxyacetone-P** synthesis
        - Can also be reduced to lyso-PA by peroxisomal **acyldihydroxyacetone-P reductase**
- **Phosphatidic acid phosphatase**
    - Hydrolyses **PA** to **DG**
        - **DG** can be converted to:
            - **TG**
            - **PC**
            - **PE**
    - Two types identified
        - Cytosolic ER form

            - Inhibited by thiol-reactive agents
                - e.g. **N-ethylmaleimide**
            - Inactive and translocated to ER membrane in presence of **fatty acid**s, **fatty acyl-CoA**s and **PA**
        - Regulated by reversable translocation between **cytosol** and **ER**
        - Substrate (**PA**) found on ER so expect ER to be where enzym functions.
        - Mammalian ortholog **lipin-1**
            - KO mice causes:
                - fatty liver dystrophy

                - **Lipin-1 phenotype** due to lack of enzyme in muscle and adipose
                    - **Fatty acid**s cannot be utilised for glycerolipid synthesis in muscle or adipose

- Historical Background
    - **PC** first described by Gobley in 1847
        - Named lecithin (egg yolk)
    - Diakonow and Strecker
        - two fatty acids linked by glycerol
        - choline attatched to third hydroxyl by phosphodiester
    - Charles Best
        - Animals require choline
    - **CDP-choline pathway** for **PC** biosynthesis
        - Eugene Kennedy et al
        - CTP not ATP is activating nucleotide for PC biosynthesis
        - CTP required for PC biosynthesis
            - Required for denovo synthesis of all phospholipids except PA
    - Alternative pathway
        - In liver
        - PE to PC via PE [15N]choline
        - Transfer of methyl groups from S-adenosylmethionine
- **Choline transport and oxidation**
    - Choline not made de novo in animals except:
        - by methylation of PE to PC
        - Then hydrolysis of choline moiety from PC
    - Imported from extracellular sources
    - Cells require for growth and division
    - Two entry mechanisms
        - High affinity
            - NA dependent transporter
        - Low afffinity
            - NA independent transporter
    - Once in cell, rapidly phosphorylated by **choline kinase**
    - In neurons converted to **acetylcholine** neurotransmitter.
    - In liver and mitochondria oxidised to betaine

    - **Choline** to **Choline-P**
