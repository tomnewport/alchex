; First include the file containing all particle definitions,
; the interaction matrix, plus the topology for water.

#include "martini_v2.1.itp"

; Then include the file(s) containing the topologies of other
; molecules present in your system.

#include "martini_v2.0_ions.itp"

; Define a name for your system
